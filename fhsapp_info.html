		<p> The app was created by a team of intelligent brain power at our very own, Franklin High School. These students, with much assistance from Gage (the advisor), are thoroughly working with the computer coding that goes along with creating a wonderful website- designed to help all students communicate through technology with their teachers and FHS!</p> </footer>
